# Generate Session Summary

Create a summary report of recent organization activities and current drive state.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather session data

Read recent logs:
```bash
ls -lt logs/sessions/ | head -10
ls -lt logs/operations/ | head -10
ls -lt logs/summaries/ | head -5
```

### Step 2: Compile statistics

From session logs, extract:
- Number of sessions in last 7/30 days
- Total files processed
- Total files moved/renamed/deleted
- Common destinations
- Error patterns

### Step 3: Current state snapshot

```bash
# Drive usage
df -h {mount_path}

# Folder sizes (top level)
du -sh {mount_path}/*/ 2>/dev/null | sort -hr | head -10

# File counts by folder
for dir in {mount_path}/*/; do
  echo "$(find "$dir" -type f | wc -l) $dir"
done | sort -rn

# Inbox status
find {mount_path}/00-Inbox -type f 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

### Step 4: Generate summary document

Create: `logs/summaries/summary_{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`

```markdown
# Google Drive Organization Summary
Generated: {timestamp}
